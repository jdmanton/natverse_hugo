title: Contribute to the natverse
---

We want the natverse to expand. No matter your current skills it's possible to contribute to the natverse by adding your own code, reporting bugs, requesting features and giving us your feedback. We are all ears, and we are keen to add new R packages, or libraries for other programming languages, to the natverse to expand its capabilities and make it more easily multi-lingual.

## Show and tell {#show}

Get in thouch nad let us know if these tools have been useful, and what you have used them for! We are always super interested to see our tools used by others. The best way to do this wouldbe by [Twitter](https://twitter.com), you can tweet [@gsxej2](https://twitter.com/gsxej) and [@as_bates](https://twitter.com/as_bates).

If you have done something cool, it would be great if you could make a pull request or open an issue for the appropriate package and offer to make a litle [vignette](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html) in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), so we cna add you example to your packges, and inspire others.

## Answer community questions {#answers}

The simplest way to help out is to answer questions posed by our community of users. We are trying to do so as well, but you ight get there first! We have an active [nat-user](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nat-user) Google forum.

## File issues {#issues}

If you've found a bug, first create a minimal, [reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Spend some time trying to make it as minimal as possible: the more time you spend doing this, the easier it will be for use to help you with it. Then file it on the GitHub repo of the appropriate package or add to the [nat-user](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nat-user) Google forum. For exmple, for nat, you could create an  issue [here](https://github.com/natverse/nat/issues).

## Contribute code to an existing package {#bugs}

If you are a middling-to-experienced programmer, you might want to pitch in with the R package development. Before you do a pull request, best practice would be to file an issue and make sure someone from our team agrees that it's a problem and you have a good solution. When it comes to how you should write your code, a great place to look is the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/).

## Contribute new packages and libraries to the natverse {#new}

If you are an experienced programmer, you might want to contribute your own R packages, or a library in a different programming language to the natverse project! Good ideas include a) talking to new, remote data repositories we have missed,  b) expanding natverse functionalities to other programming languages, for example by using [MATLAB R-Link](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5051-matlab-r-link),  c) making tools to integrate the natverse with other anaysis suits, like the [TREES toolbox](https://www.treestoolbox.org/) or d) expanding the analysis capabilities of the natverse. Philipp Schlegel's Python 3 library [NAVis](https://github.com/schlegelp/navis) is a great example of expanding the naterse mentality into another programming language.

The easiest way to conribute large amounts of code to the natverse is as an [R package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). R packages are discrete bundles of code. It is preferable to develop sets of functions as separate packages because this helps siloe development, ease troubleshooting and divides the natverse into units within which users can search for the more specific code examples or functions that they want.

If you would like to contribute a large amount of new code to the project, get in touch with [Gregory Jefferis](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/h-to-m/gregory-jefferis/).
